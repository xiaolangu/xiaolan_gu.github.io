# About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Arizona from Fall 2018, working with Prof. [Ming Li](http://wiser.arizona.edu/mingli/index.html). In Summer 2019, I was a research intern at Baidu Security Lab.  Before that, I received B.S. (in Mathematics and System Science) and M.S. (in Automation Science and Electrical Engineering) at Beihang University.  

My research interest includes privacy-preserving techniques (e.g., Differential Privacy and Secure Multi-Party Computation) and robust machine learning/federated learning (against adversarial examples and poisoning attacks).
