# About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Arizona from Fall 2018, working with Prof. [Ming Li](http://wiser.arizona.edu/mingli/index.html). In Summer 2019, I was an intern at Baidu Security.  Before that, I received B.S. in the School of Mathematics and System Science and M.E. in the School of Automation Science and Electrical Engineering at Beihang University.  

My research interest includes (local) differential privacy and robustness of machine learning models.
